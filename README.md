## Personal Computer Profile by Kelsey Brester
### Components of My PC: HP Envyx360 (2022) and Its Functions
#### 1. Features: touchscreen, backlit keyboard, webcam
* Touchscreen: allows user to interact with device by touching it with their fingers or a stylus  
* Backlit keyboard: illuminates keys on a keyboard to make them easier to see in low light conditions  
* Webcam: captures and transmits video and audio data  
#### 2. Processor Type: 15.6-inch diagonal, FHD (1920x1080), multitouch-enabled, IPS, edge-to-edge glass, microedge, 250 nits, 45% NTSC
* 15.6 inches diagonal display screen
* FHD (1920x1080): Full High Definition with 1920x1080 resolution
* Multitouch-enabled: allows device to respond to multiple points of contact (touchscreen and touchpad) simultaneously
* Intrusion Prevention System (IPS): monitors network activity to identify and prevent security threats
* Edge to edge glass: seamless transitions from interior to exterior viewing area
* Microedge: protects critical data with intuitive interface, simplifying security management, while maintaining operational integrity
* 250 nits: unit of measurement for screen brightness that indicates how luminescent a display screen is
* 45% National Television Standards Committee (NTSC): refers to the color gamut coverage indicating that the device can reproduce approximately 45% of the color range defined by NTSC standards
#### 3. RAM Memory: 8 GB
  * Allows user to run multiple high end applications simultaneously without any noticeable slowdown in performance and enable faster boot times due to less hard drive activity being required to load all the programs running at once.
#### 5. Hard Drive Capacity: 512 GB
* The hard drive capacity can store 512 gigabytes of data.
#### 6. Operating System: Windows 10 Home
* Consumer version of the Windows 10 operating system, providing all the essential features for everyday computer use, but lacking advanced features found in the Pro version, making it suitable for most home users.
#### 7. Processor Core Type: Quad-Core
* Can handle multiple tasks at the same time by using its four independent processing units, or cores.
#### 8. Processor Speed: 4.2 GHz
* The CPU can execute instructions at a rate of 4.2 billion cycles per second, signifying a relatively high processing power which is suitable for demanding tasks.
#### 9. Optical Disk Drive Type: No optical drive
* This computer is unable to read or write data from a CD, DVD, or Blu-ray disc.
#### 10. RAM Memory Speed: 3200 MHz
* RAM can access data at a rate of 3200 million cycles per second, meaning it can retrieve and store information from the CPU, translating to overall faster system performance.
#### 11. Solid State Drive Capacity: 512 GB
* Common storage space for most performance tasks.
#### 12. RAM Memory Type: DDR SDRAM
* Significantly increases data transfer speeds by transferring data on rising and falling edges of a clock signal, doubling the bandwidth compared to SDRAM.
